    "### Challenge:\n",
    "Write a loop to print the headlines, urls, and dates for each article in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "1. Within your formatted_articles list, each item is represented in a dictionary key:value pair. To display the value, use the syntax ```variable_name['key_name']``` \n",
    "2. A good way to start your loop would be: ```for article in formatted_articles:```\n",
    "3. It's helpful to display the article number as you print each article. You can use an iterator variable to do that, and use ```x += 1``` at the end of the loop to keep the iterator in line with the loop.\n",
    "4. Within ```print()``` you can call multiple variables using commas: ```print(variable_one, '\\n', variable_two['key_name'])```\n",
    " - Note that ```'\\n'``` will add a line break to the output, which can make things easier to read.\n"
